### Project Overview

- Why working on this project in the first place?
    - Process improvement and scalability, building on the ideas from OS 1.0.
    - Previous approach was labor intensive.
- Why custom instead of off-the-shelf for OS 2.0?
    - This is what Jeff knows how to do.

- Project timeframe
    - Ideal
        - Beta by July 12
        - Release by July 26
    - Can be flexible if necessary to do this the "right way"

### Details

#### QA

- Need many people to hammer on the beta.

#### Hosting

- Multiple level models
    - Corporate model - prove everything happened the way we expect
    - "Nerd" model - build everything from first principles
- Corwin recommends avoiding nerd model
- Cloud platforms
    - Control vs "walled garden" integration
    - Cost vs SLA
    - End up making your application integrated into their idiosyncracies
    - To avoid that, you end up putting in the same amount of work as creating your own solution
- VPS (Virtual Private Server)
    - Digital ocean
- Containerization to simplify deployment and ensure consistency
- Security
- Deployment Actions
- Dragon's proposed approach
    - Get VPS
    - Put Docker stack on it
    - Deploy with docker compose
- Corwin has already tested off-shore VM offerings.
    - Cerberus (Canada)
    - Various services, $300 per year for 24cpu total
    - Host nation stability and government facility and politics should play a role
    - Even with friendly nations, beware of treaties and compliance with the US
    - Hosting in other nations has a marketing effect
        - Off-shore hosting can be seen as negative with average Americans, who are our customers.
    - We need administrative and legal guidance on this front

#### Project Management

- Pizza project management thoughts
    - Milestones
    - Stretch
    - Dates
    - Roles
- For next time
    - Test/QA plan
    - Reach out to Ellie about this

#### Action Items

- Docker compose integration
- Building a script to ensure environment state as part of install/run scripts.
- Publish these notes
- Publish project management notes
- Creating/refining documentation and form refinement
- Resolving repo issues
- Reality check available people-hours, for each kind of task
- Investigating VPS vendors and reporting findings
